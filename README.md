# Restaurant Reviews App — Stage 1

### Project Overview
This is my third project of the Advanced Front-End course, from Udacity Brasil. The goal was to fix and change the app applying the knowledge learned during the lessons.

#### Click [**_[here]_**](https://dekisr.github.io/Udacity-FrontEnd-P03-RReviewStage1) to check the project online.

### Specification
**From Udacity:**
> For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.  
>You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

## Instructions
You can clone or download this repository and then you'll need to run a local server (**localhost:8000**).  
I use the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package, but you can choose anything you want.

For http-server:
> npm install http-server -g  
> http-server -p 8000

You can also change the port on **dbhelper.js** file.
